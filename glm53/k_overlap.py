"""Overlap the shared expert with the MoE miss path (decode, bsz <= 8).

Stock exllamav3 decode MoE layer (with glm53 expert_cache + cpu_tier), one stream:
    routing -> ft_split -> ec_step -> ec_copy (PCIe gather of admitted misses, ~0.38 ms/expert, link-bound)
            -> run_bszN (routed coop kernels + shared expert coop merged in kernel B) -> ft_combine (CPU-tier wait)
Here:
  - the shared expert is taken out of the fused kernel (BC_BlockSparseMLP built with sh_exp_bc = None, sh_coop off)
    and launched on a side stream right after routing, on the MoE input, through GatedMLP.forward (its BC graph);
    it runs concurrently with ec_copy / routed coop / the CPU-tier wait, and joins at the stock python add
    (BlockSparseMLP.forward: final_hidden_states += shared_experts.forward(x))
  - ec_copy should run on few blocks (GLM53_EC_COPY_GRID=16, expert_cache.py): 16 blocks still saturate the link
    (25.0 GB/s, kernels/k102) but leave the SMs free; the stock 656-block grid blocks concurrent kernels
Numerics: shared expert through the GatedMLP graph instead of the coop kernel, and added after ft_combine instead of
inside coop B -> not bitwise vs stock decode (~2e-3 rel on the layer output, same as EXL3_MOE_SHARED_COOP=0);
prefill (the teacher-forced panel) is unchanged (python shared path there already).
Env: GLM53_K_OVL=1 -> serve.py: k_overlap.install() before load, k_overlap.attach(model) after the cache/tier.
